cd aeterno-template-dev
```

## Usage

The following sections describe how to use the components of this repository effectively in your projects.

### Cursor IDE Rules

The `.cursor` directory contains rules and configurations that enhance the Cursor IDE experience. These can be referenced in your projects to maintain consistent AI-assisted development patterns:

- **Context Rules**: The `context/` directory contains domain-specific knowledge rules like Tailwind CSS v4 usage.
- **Tool Rules**: The `tools/` directory contains utility rules for interacting with git, generating docs, and other development tasks.

### Advanced Reasoning Rule

The enhanced reasoning methodology in the `agent.mdc` file provides a rule-based framework that demonstrates significant improvements in thought process and analysis depth, resulting in more thorough and methodical problem-solving.

Key benefits include:
- Deeper analytical processes with structured reasoning
- More comprehensive consideration of all aspects of a problem
- Enhanced self-questioning and exploratory thinking
- Systematic approach to breaking down complex tasks
- Clear progression from initial impressions to well-reasoned conclusions

The improved reasoning rule ensures more accurate and thorough responses to complex queries, providing better guidance and more reliable solutions.
